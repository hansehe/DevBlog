![This is me][1]

I am a full stack developer based in Northern Norway, Tromsø, who thrives to build advanced software systems with high degree of quality at minimal expence to efficiency. 

Software development means handling complexity at a daily basis, and both quality and efficiency is difficult to maintain as complexity increases. Although complexity doesn't go away when converting your monolith to microservices, it helps to isolate the complexity in smaller and more manageable services. The complexity moves from a large system tangled with inconceivable interfaces constrained by one programming language, to a more human friendly language - message patterns. 

This site will introduce various aspects of the microservice architecture, and present ideas and thoughts on how to fall into the 'pit of success' when developing a distributed microservice system.
